          <h2>Why San Diego?</h2>
<h3>America's 'Finest City'</h3>
<p>San Diego (Spanish for 'Saint Didacus') is a city located in the extreme south-west of the U.S. state of California. With over 1.3 million residents, the city is the eighth-most populous in the USA. Immediately adjacent to the Mexicoâ€“United States border,  San Diego is known for its mild year-round Mediterranean climate, extensive beaches and parks, its long association with the United States Navy, and its recent emergence as a healthcare and biotech development centre. The city's airport is the busiest single-runway airport in the world.
</p>
<p>
 Historically home to the Kumeyaay Native Americans, San Diego has been referred to as the Birthplace of California. Upon landing in San Diego Bay in 1542, Juan RodrÃ­guez Cabrillo claimed the area for Spain, forming the basis for the settlement of Alta California 200 years later. In 1821, San Diego became part of the newly declared Mexican Empire. California was conquered by the U.S. in 1848 following the Mexicanâ€“American War and was admitted to the union as a state in 1850.
