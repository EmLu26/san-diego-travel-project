          <h2>Why San Diego?</h2>
<h3>America's 'Finest City'</h3>
<p>San Diego (Spanish for 'Saint Didacus') is a city located in the extreme south-west of the U.S. state of California. With over 1.3 million residents, the city is the eighth-most populous in the USA. Immediately adjacent to the Mexicoâ€“United States border,  San Diego is known for its mild year-round Mediterranean climate, extensive beaches and parks, its long association with the United States Navy, and its recent emergence as a healthcare and biotech development centre. The city's airport is the busiest single-runway airport in the world.
</p>
<p>
 Historically home to the Kumeyaay Native Americans, San Diego has been referred to as the Birthplace of California. Upon landing in San Diego Bay in 1542, Juan RodrÃ­guez Cabrillo claimed the area for Spain, forming the basis for the settlement of Alta California 200 years later. In 1821, San Diego became part of the newly declared Mexican Empire. California was conquered by the U.S. in 1848 following the Mexicanâ€“American War and was admitted to the union as a state in 1850.

<p>
  An amazing place to visit. The Zoo has a strong conservationist approach, which appeals to me, and is a fantastic day out. From elephants and giraffes to hippos, lions and even red pandas, you'll have the chance to see incredible wildlife up close.

<h4>Balboa Park</h4>
    <p>
San Diegoâ€™s ever-changing, always amazing, 1,200-acre backyard. Thereâ€™s always something new to experience! Check out the festivals, concerts, and events. From Arts and Culture, Attractions and Experiences to Park Trails and Gardens, there's something for everyone!
    </p>
<h5>Address:</h5>
<p>Balboa Park, San Diego, CA</p>
<h5>What I like about it</h5>
<p>
  Absolutely stunning - I barely scratched the surface when I went! Cycle round and be spontaneous. If you only have time for one thing, check out the Park's (free) beloved Botanical Building and Lily Pond. Definitely one for all the culture vultures out there!

<h4>Petco Park</h4>
    <p>
Home to the Padres, Petco Park is a stunning stadium, combining the best sight lines in baseball with breathtaking views of San Diego. Cheer on the Padres in the MLB National League, and learn about the history of the club and the stadium on one of the daily tours.
    </p>
<h5>Address:</h5>
<p>100 Park Blvd. San Diego, CA 92101</p>
<h5>What I like about it</h5>
<p>
  If you want the All-American experience, you have to catch a baseball game! Lend your support to the Padres and get involved - the action's not just on the field, but off it, with tempting snacks such as tacos, carnitas, sushi, and of course pizza and hot dogs to choose from!
